                Metallica is an American heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California. The band was formed in 1981 by drummer Lars Ulrich
                and vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship
                made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's
                current lineup comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist
                Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who formed Megadeth) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and
                Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

                Metallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement
                in a Los Angeles newspaper, The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with
                Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm
                answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian
                Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted,
                and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar. The band was officially formed on October 28,
                1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.

                Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin,
                Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, and Scorpions. New wave of British heavy metal bands
                Venom, Motörhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex
                Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke. The band's
                early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of
                AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers". Huey
                said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive
                approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues. Religious and
                military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs—among other themes—were explored on Master of Puppets.
